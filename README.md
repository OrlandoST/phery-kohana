Kohana module with tight integration for Phery.js library https://github.com/pocesar/phery

Working with AJAX (including file uploads) never been simpler. Just add the `phery.js` file on your page
(or if you are using an assets manager, add PHERY_JS to the bunch), and instead of using `Controller`, use
`Phery_Controller` and instead of `Controller_Template` use `Phery_Template`.
